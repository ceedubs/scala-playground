Prezi presentation from the meetup: [Scala Parallel Collections][prezi]

[Scala Collections for the Easily Bored][easily-bored] is a series of blog posts that document one developer's journey with Scala's collections.

The [ParRange documentation][ParRange-doc] provides a helpful introduction to implementing your own custom parallel collection. (You'll probably never do this, but it's good learning material.)
